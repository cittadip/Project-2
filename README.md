Project 2: \
Before the user can even access the automatic headlight system, the vehicle must be started under strict conditions.
These conditions include both the passenger and the driver being seated in the vehicle, with their seatbelts fastened.
Under these conditions, the user can successfully start the vehicle, making the automatic headlight system possible.


The user can then select from three modes for the headlights: ON, OFF, or AUTO. If ON is selected, the headlights will turn on. 
If OFF is selected, the headlights will turn off. If AUTO is selected, a light sensor will detect whether it is daylight or dusk.
If daylight is detected, the headlights should turn off after a delay of 2 seconds. If dusk is detected, the headlights should 
turn on after a delay of 1 second. If the light sensor is between these two levels, it will hold its previous state. 
The headlights will turn off once the engine is turned off.
