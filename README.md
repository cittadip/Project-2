## Automatic Headlight System
By Adam Otsuka, Philip Cittadino

### Project Description 
The goal of the project was to create an automatic headlight system which contained all the safety features from Project 1. \

Project 2: \
Before the user can even access the automatic headlight system, the vehicle must be started under strict conditions.
These conditions include both the passenger and the driver being seated in the vehicle, with both their seatbelts fastened.
Under these conditions, the user can successfully start the vehicle, making the automatic headlight system possible.


The user can then select from three modes for the headlights: ON, OFF, or AUTO. If ON is selected, both headlights will turn on. 
If OFF is selected, the headlights will turn off. If AUTO is selected, a light sensor will detect whether it is daylight or dusk.
If daylight is detected, the headlights should turn off after a delay of 2 seconds. If dusk is detected, the headlights should 
turn on after a delay of 1 second. If the light sensor is between these two levels, it will hold its previous state. 
Two additional automatic high-beams were added to the project with a switch differentiating between high-beam or low-beam.
One LED ON indicates low-beam while two LEDs on indicates high-beam. These high-beam match the same behavior of the 
headlights mentioned earlier.


### Project Results
As mentioned previously a headlight system was added to the smart ignition system which increased saftey in vehicles. 
The driver and passenger must be seated and both have their seatbelts in order to start the vehicle. If the user fails to do
this appropriate error messages will be displayed and an alarm will go off, however the user will be allowed to try again without
having to reset the system. \
Once the engine has been started the user can implement the headlight system where they can select between
